We will use a reliable and regulated platform called Coinbase.&nbsp;Stay tuned, because at the end of the article I'll show you how you can earn bonus Bitcoin in the Coinbase.</p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/cunha_d1" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid d-block" src="../assets/images/coinbase.png"></a>

          <p class="lead">OK let's start. The first step is easy and straightforward.&nbsp;You just have to access the following <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/cunha_d1" target="_blank">link</a> and create your own Coinbase account. To receive the bonus that I told you before, you really have to create the account through this link.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/cunha_d1" target="_blank">https://www.coinbase.com/join/cunha_d1</a><br>Do not forget to confirm that you are at least 18 years old and accept the User Agreement and Privacy Policy. After creating your account, you must confirm your email address.</p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/cunha_d1" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/images/coinbase-create-account.png"></a>
          <p class="lead mt-4">When you confirm your email, you will also have to confirm your phone number for security reasons.&nbsp;Then validate your identity with your real data.<br>The last step of this set up is to check your legal document, this can be a citizen card or even a driving license</p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/cunha_d1" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/images/coinbase-document-verification.png"></a>

          <p class="lead">Now that you have an account on the Coinbase platform, you are getting very close to receiving your Bitcoins for free and I'm very excited to be able to help you with this task.</p><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/images/coinbase-earn.png">
          <p class="lead mt-4">The next big step is to go to this link: <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/earn" target="_blank">https://www.coinbase.com/earn</a>. On this page you opened will appear a list of tutorials provided by Coinbase. And it is at this stage that you will be able to profit from nothing, as some of the tutorials offer you cryptocurrencies just for completing them.<br>Each tutorial takes no more than 15 minutes to complete. You receive the cryptocurrency corresponding to the tutorial instantly in your coinbase wallet. With the cryptocurrency in your wallet, no one will take it away and you can exchange it for free for Bitcoin. </p>

          <h1 class="mb-3">Earning example</h1>
          <p class="lead mb-0 text-left">I will show you an example of a cryptocurrency that I won just for completing a tutorial. As an extra I'll show you how to convert to Bitcoin.&nbsp;To show you, I chose BAT (Basic Attention Token) as an example. And as you can see in the image below, I already received $ 10 in BAT currency.</p><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/images/coinbase-earn-bat.png">
          <p class="lead mt-4">In this case to earn the $ 10 in BAT, I had to receive 3 lessons in videos of 1 to 2 minutes and install a web browser.&nbsp;When the videos were over, I had to answer a multiple choice question. I had no worry or stress in responding, because the 1 to 2 minute videos teach about this BAT coin.&nbsp;Whenever I finished watching one of the videos, I received the prize instantly. And when I installed the browser I received the remaining amount.&nbsp;You can see in the image below the payment records of my BAT cryptocurrency wallet in the coinbase.</p><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/images/coinbase-bat-payments.png">
          <p class="lead mt-4">Finally going to the overview page of this cryptocurrency, I can convert my value in BAT (Basic Attention Token) to Bitcoin for free.&nbsp;You can click on the "Convert All" button which will automatically choose your entire BAT value. Right after click on the button "Convert Basic Attention Token" you will instantly receive the corresponding amount in Bitcoin.</p><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="../assets/images/coinbase-convert-bat-to-btc.png">
          <p class="lead mt-4">And that's it! These are the steps to receive Bitcoin for free.&nbsp;If you liked it, share it with your friends so they can also earn your free Bitcoin.</p>
